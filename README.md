# Pipeline temperature hardware 
a hardware core in verilog, of a simple controller with a UART protocol implementation.   
the controller interfaces to an ADC and measures temperature periodically, sending readings remotely using UART   
and controlling the pipeline valve to prevent overheating, further details are in [Uart & pipeTemp.pdf](Uart & pipeTemp.pdf).
